# ML_course
This is a course for anyone who wants to take a deep dive to ML. I try to show you how to solve different tasks using different ML libraries. I hope you find something of interest to you here.  Friends, don't be afraid to make mistakes, to ask  basic things. The most important thing is to try and go all the way with a smile on your face!
